# Google's Vimscript Style Guide Snippet

## Maktaba

Maktaba is a vimscript plugin library. It is designed for plugin authors. Features include:

* Plugin objects (for manipulating plugins in vimscript)
* Plugin flags (used to configure plugins without global settings)
* Universal logger interface
* Dependency management tools
* Real closures

Maktaba advocates a plugin structure that, when adhered to, gives the plugin access to many powerful tools such as configuration flags. Within Google, these conventions standardize behavior across a wide variety of plugins.

Also contained are many utility functions that ease the pain of working with vimscript. This includes, among other things:

* Exception handling
* Variable type enforcement
* Filepath manipulation

Maktaba relies heavily on dependency management, so I'd recommend use something like VAM.

Installation of a few plugins using VAM looks something like:

```vim
set runtimepath+=~/.vim/bundle/vim-addon-manager/
" Loads glaive, vtd, and their maktaba dependency.
call vam#ActivateAddons(['glaive', 'vtd'])
" Initializes all maktaba plugins.
call maktaba#plugin#Detect()
```

We can generate help tags for a file by by installing maktaba and `fakeplugins/myplugin`:

  ```vim
  :set nocompatible
  :let g:maktabadir = fnamemodify($VROOMFILE, ':p:h:h')
  :let g:bootstrapfile = g:maktabadir . '/bootstrap.vim'
  :execute 'source' g:bootstrapfile

We need write access to the plugin in order to generate help files, so let's
copy it to a tmp directory:

  :let g:thisdir = fnamemodify($VROOMFILE, ':p:h')
  :let g:srcpath = maktaba#path#Join([g:thisdir, 'fakeplugins', 'myplugin'])
  :let g:tmpdir = fnamemodify(tempname(), ':h')
  :call maktaba#system#Call(['cp', '-R', g:srcpath, g:tmpdir])
  :let g:pluginpath = maktaba#path#Join([g:tmpdir, 'myplugin'])
  :let g:myplugin = maktaba#plugin#Install(g:pluginpath)

Observe: There is no bunny in the hat:

  :let g:tagfile = maktaba#path#Join([g:pluginpath, 'doc', 'tags'])
  :call maktaba#ensure#IsFalse(maktaba#path#Exists(g:tagfile))

Maktaba makes them for us:

  :call g:myplugin.GenerateHelpTags()

And now the helpfiles exist!

  :call maktaba#ensure#IsTrue(maktaba#path#Exists(g:tagfile))

Not only that, but the helpfiles are useful.

  :help myhelp
                                                                       *myhelp*
  These are my help files.

Well... somewhat.

Now let's reset the test for next time:

  :call maktaba#system#Call(['rm', '-R', g:pluginpath])
```

Several plugins are [already using maktaba](https://github.com/google/maktaba/wiki/Plugins-Using-Maktaba). As a user, you can generally expect these plugins to be configurable using [Glaive](https://github.com/google/glaive) and be more well-behaved in terms of things like defining unwanted global mappings and variables and avoiding annoying side-effects like moving your cursor.



## Whitespace

Similar to Python: 

* Use two spaces for indents
* Do not use tabs
* Use spaces around operators

This does not apply to arguments to commands.

```vim
let s:variable = "concatenated " . "strings"
command -range=% MyCommand

* Do not introduce trailing whitespace

You need not go out of your way to remove it. Trailing whitespace is allowed in mappings which prep commands for user input, such as ```noremap <leader>gf :grep -f ```.

* Restrict lines to 80 columns wide
* Indent continued lines by four spaces
* Do not align arguments of commands
  
Without Google styleguide:

```vim
command -bang MyCommand  call myplugin#foo()
command       MyCommand2 call myplugin#bar()
```
With Google styleguide: 

```vim
command -bang MyCommand call myplugin#foo()
command MyCommand2 call myplugin#bar()
```

## Dangerous commands 

Avoid commands with unintended side effects.

Avoid using `:s[ubstitute]` as it moves the cursor and prints error messages. Prefer functions (such as `search())` better suited to scripts.

For many vim commands, functions exist that do the same thing with fewer side effects.

## Type checking 

Use strict and explicit checks where possible.

Vimscript has unsafe, unintuitive behavior when dealing with some types. For instance, `0 == 'foo'` evaluates to true.

Use strict comparison operators where possible. When comparing against a string literal, use the `is#` operator. Otherwise, prefer `maktaba#value#IsEqual` or check `type()` explicitly.

Check variable types explicitly before using them. Use functions from `maktaba#ensure`, or check `maktaba#value` or `type()` and throw your own errors.

Use `:unlet` for variables that may change types, particularly those assigned inside loops.

## Functions 

In the autoload/ directory, defined with `[!]` and `[abort]`.

Autoloading allows functions to be loaded on demand, which makes startuptime faster and enforces function namespacing.

`Script-local` functions are welcome, but should also live in autoload/ and be called by autoloaded functions.

Non-library plugins should expose commands instead of functions. Command logic should be extracted into functions and autoloaded.

`[!]` allows developers to reload their functions without complaint.

`[abort]` forces the function to halt when it encounters an error.


## Prefix all variables with their scope

`g:`, `s:`, and `a:` must always be used.

`b:` changes the variable semantics; use it when you want buffer-local semantics.

`l:` and `v:` should be used for consistency, future proofing, and to avoid subtle bugs. They are not strictly required. Add them in new code but donâ€™t go out of your way to add them elsewhere.

## Regex 

Prefix all regexes with `\m\C`.

In addition to the case sensitivity settings, regex behavior depends upon the user's nomagic setting. To make regexes act like nomagic and noignorecase are set, prepend all regexes with `\m\C`.

You are welcome to use other magic levels `(\v)` and case sensitivities `(\c)` so long as they are intentional and explicit.
